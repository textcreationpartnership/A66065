            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36651:6"/> have them conſider, firſt, that they are not <hi>regnantes,</hi> but <hi>remanentes, Not regnant, but remanent,</hi> being in ſuch as walk not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, but after the ſpirit; not after the motions of the unregenerate, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part; and <hi>poſt remotionem reatus per juſtificationem, gradualiter diminuuntur per ſanctificationem,</hi> After the removing of the guilt by juſtification they are gradually deminiſhed by ſanctification; ſo that, as the Lord ſaid of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Iſrael, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.22. that he would conſume them by little and little; even ſo likewiſe will he do with our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enemies, our ſins, the Lord will kill them &amp; conſume them by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power of ſanctification, by little and little, and take out the <hi>Macula</hi> or ſtaine of them, and ſubdue the vitulencie of them; for as there is an increaſe in grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt,</hi> ſo there is a decreaſe in ſin; for even as the ſtrength and heat of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36651:7"/> Sunne is increaſed, the coldneſſe of the Air is diminiſhed; ſo the ſtronger grace and zeal from it growes, the coldneſſe of ſinne is more diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>And though it be true, that many eminent Divines ſay, that <hi>juſtificatio</hi> is <hi>actus individuus,</hi> an individuall act, and perfected <hi>uno actu,</hi> and <hi>quaſi uno ictu,</hi> at once, and that in it ſelfe it admits of no degrees, (properly ſo called) but that <hi>quoad ſenſum &amp; manifeſtationem,</hi> in the ſenſe and manifeſtation of it to the hearts and mindes of men, it admits of diverſe degrees, every one in his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication not having the like manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his juſtification; ſome diſcerning it more ſweetly and ſatisfactorily, <hi>&amp; magis continuate,</hi> with leſſe intermiſſion: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more weakly, more obſcurely, with reluctancy; and ſometimes doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly; who notwithſtanding <hi>(lucidiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus intervallis)</hi> when the temptation and

            <p>Now our ſanctification is <hi>actus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus et gradualis,</hi> a dividuall and graduall act: we are ſanctified by degrees, and by ſuch meanes as God in his wiſdome hath appointed to increaſe ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by.</p>
            <p>And whereas in juſtification the <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata praeterita,</hi> or <hi>fore-paſt ſinnes</hi> before calling, or <hi>praeſentia,</hi> are pardoned, <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliter in ſeſe, &amp; per formalem applicationem juſtificationis,</hi> actually, and in themſelves,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36651:8"/> and by the formall application of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, yet the <hi>peccata futura,</hi> or ſinnes not committed, into which the juſtified perſons afterwards may fall by infirmity, by negligence, by violent temptation, or the like; though theſe be pardoned alſo <hi>decretive, intentionaliter et virtualiter perſonae juſtificatae,</hi> decretively, intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and vertually to the juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, being now put in the road of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his juſtification, yet actually and manifeſtatively they are not pardoned (in themſelves) untill they be confeſſed, the partie be humbled, and have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf of them, and for ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Acts applies his former juſtification to him. No man can upon good grounds deny, but that <hi>David</hi> before he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted adultery with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> was a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Perſon, yet that ſinne he fell into with her is not ſaid to be put away, till he (being convinced by <hi>Nathan</hi>) confeſſed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36651:8"/> it, and was ſenſible of it, and touched for it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. he to whom God hath decreed pardon of ſinne, hath alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that he ſhall repent, to whom ſinn ſhall be pardoned. Thus much for <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiae peccati.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the ſecond, the <hi>afflictiones mundi,</hi> the croſſes and troubles which befall men after they be in a juſtified and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified eſtate, how this can ſtand with Gods Juſtice, having puniſhed their ſins in Chriſt: to which it may be ſaid, that there are juſt cauſes of them remaining in man, and in his ſecret Counſell hee knowes how to make them medicinable to his ſervants; and theſe though they be not <hi>poenae ſatisfactoriae,</hi> yet are they <hi>poenae caſtigatoriae,</hi> though they bee not ſatisfactory puniſhments, as were thoſe that Chriſt did undergo; yet were they <hi>poenae caſtigatoriae,</hi> caſtigatorie puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which God keeps his Children
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36651:9"/> in obedience: for though his ſanctified Children obey out of love, <hi>via praevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> by way of prevalencie, yet are there in them ſtill reliques of ſervile feare, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the rod works: and this may ſerve for the praecedany to the words of the Text.</p>
            <p>Now to fall in nearer to the words themſelves. In the 18 Verſe we read of a glory that ſhall be revealed in us, which glory is that glorious eſtate which man (made immortall) ſhall be inveſted with from God; which glory God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver manifeſted in man, whileſt man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued mortall; but then our vile bodies ſhall be like unto his glorious Bodie;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.49.</note> when wee ſhall have the Image of Chriſt perfectly reſtored in us: and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. laſt, <hi>He ſhall change our vile body, that it may be like his glorious body.</hi>

So then take it <hi>ſubject to vanity,</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt that cannot erre in Expoſition, tells us, that to be ſubject to vanitie is to be ſubject to corruption, or the bondage of corruption. Verſe 21. where its ſaid, It ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, that was the vanitie it was made ſubject to for the ſinne of man: it remaines not in that quiet, conſtant, entire, ſound and firme eſtate of nature, in the which at the firſt it was created, but is now ſubject <hi>fluxae turbidae</hi> &amp;

            <p>If any man object, that the heavens are not of a corruptible nature: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, (and of which point God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling more hereafter) that though by the Ariſtotelians they be not of ſuch corruptible nature, or ſubject to ſuch viciſſitude of change, as compound and mixt Elementary bodies be; yet are they ſubject to obſcuration, and doing of ſervice to prophane and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked enemies of God, and to diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their Maker, as well as inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bodies are. For ſuppoſe the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens be incorruptible, <hi>corruptione na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali,</hi> by naturall corruption; yet

            <p>But ſeeing that the Air is become troubled, the Heavens darkned, the Earth barren, the Sea incumbred, the ſenſible Creature diſeaſed, weakned and often changed in its ſeverall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividualls, this ſhould humble man, when he conſiders, that for his ſinne all this miſerie, mutability, and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty befell all theſe Creatures, all that God brought to him, put him in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of, and made him Lord over; for his diſobedience to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of both, came this miſery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>Secondly, ſee the odiouſneſſe of ſinne, in that God did not onely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh man, the Creature that offended, but ſuch other Creatures alſo as were made for mans uſe, to refreſh his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, feed his Body, be his Servants, in obeying that Dominion which God gave him over them, and in puniſhing the Creatures, and mans Poſſeſſion, by which he ſhould be relieved; he alſo by conſequent, puniſheth man.

            <p>It is commonly obſerved in Fiſhes, that in great Winds they have alwayes a care by natures inſtinct, to ſwimme againſt them, if they be occaſioned to move, eſpecially in violent water, or ſwift &amp; heady cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, &amp; any conſiderable diſtance, leſt if the winds in their ſwimming com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behinde them ſhould by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the waves, and water, beat up, and beat off their ſcales, ruffle their Fins, and often claſh <hi>(in Branchias)</hi> into their Gills, which would much vex and diſquiet them; but if they be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, or in eminent danger, then will they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36651:31"/> move contrary to their naturall bent, though with danger of their lives. I have obſerved in fiſhes of ſmall quantity, and ſuch as uſually ſhove, ſhoale, or ſwimme together by many in a company, that even in a calm ſeaſon, and quiet current, yet when they have come to the fall of a ſtream or break of water, they have all together made head againſt the ſtream, and ſuffered the water to drive them down back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. So of this no more. I now come to the way how they became ſubiect to vanitie, as thus, Firſt, if we conſider the meritorious cauſe, why they were made thus ſubiect to vanity, it was the ſinne, or diſobedience of man, as in part you have heard.</p>

And many other Countries have alſo been infeſted by them: and it appears by the ſpeech of <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he ſaw the Coat of <hi>Ioſ ph,</hi> that mankinde was then moleſted by cruell Brutes; and ſo it appears by the conſultation of his Brethren.

And thus though the Creature was puniſhed by the ſinne of man, yet we often read how God makes the Creatures Inſtruments to puniſh man, for whoſe ſinn they are ſo puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the next eminent enemy of mankinde, is the Evening Wolf; <hi>Lupus veſpertinus,</hi> as <hi>Iunius,</hi> often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Holy Writ:<note place="margin">Ier. 5.6.</note> as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 5.6. where he threatens, that a Lion out of the Forreſt ſhall ſlay their great

Thus <hi>Zephanie</hi> 3.3.<note place="margin">zeph. 3.3.</note> Her Princes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her are roaring Lions, her Judges are Evening Wolves. And <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.8.<note place="margin">Habak. 1.8.</note> Their Horſes alſo are ſwifter than the Leopards, and fiercer then the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Wolves. Hiſtorians write of the Leopard to be ſo ſwift, that as the Tyger, when men ſteale away her Whelpes, being well mounted on the ſpeedieſt Horſes, yet ſhe purſuing the footſteps, and with that exceeding diligence and velocitie, they have no

The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is the Wolf, is called the Evening Wolfe, becauſe that is the time when he creeps out of his lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places to ſeek for his Prey.<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.20.</note>

            <p>Fourthly, the ſerpent hath been an inſtrument not only to deceive our firſt Parents, but to puniſh many of their poſteritie. <hi>Amos.</hi> 9.3.<note place="margin">Amos 9.3.</note> Though they be hid from my ſight in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea, thence will I command the Serpent, and he ſhall bite them.

            <p>Secondly, This judgement muſt fall on them at ſuch a time, as it was moſt terrible, as you have heard, ſo that the circumſtance of time did increaſe the plague that God inflicted on them. The more ſuddenly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly that any trouble aſſailes us, the more grievouſly it afflicts us, and eſpecially on the night, when we
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:36651:74"/> are ſetled to reſt. The old <hi>Moraliſt</hi> plainly, yet truly, ſaid, <hi>Levius laedit quicquid praevideris ante,</hi> Things fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen leſſe hurt us when they fall upon us, becauſe in the interim we prepare our ſelves againſt they fall: <hi>praemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, praemunitus,</hi> fore-warned, fore-armed. The efficient cauſe of the Creatures ſubjection to vanitie, was God, who [as you have heard] was the abſolute Lord of the Creature, he hath ſubjected the ſame <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Hope is here aſcribed to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as unwillingneſſe was, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation was, which, as you have heard, cannot properly be predicated of the Creature here mentioned,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.

               </gap>, Under hope, or in hope: but of what? I anſwer, under hope of being delivered from the bondage of coruption, for he that hath ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Creature to vanity, yet intends not forever to involve the Creature under the curſe; no, you have heard verſe 19. that there is an earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Creature, of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the ſonns of God, the Creature ſtands as it were upon tipp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes &amp; as ſtretching out the neck, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with great earneſtneſſe and deſire
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:36651:75"/> to ſee that day when the ſonns or children of God ſhall be manifeſted in that glorious ſtate, which in this life, during their mortall bodies, cannot be ſeen, and the hope of the Creature is nothing elſe but the naturall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of liberation from the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent corruption. For there is <hi>appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titus naturaliter inſitus, qui ſanè non erit perpetuò irritus,</hi> There is a naturall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite in the Creature, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhall not be continually, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fruſtrate of this expectation.</p>
            <p>And in that the Lord of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made them thus ſubject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, we may collect, that this vanitie or corruption, to which they are now ſubject, was not naturall, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, or connaturall to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God made it in a more excellent and healthfull conſtitution; but this was adventitiall, by reaſon of the ſinn
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:36651:75"/> of man, who having diſpleaſed both his Maker and theirs, brought them into an ill condition, but himſelf into a worſe; them lyable to vanity, but himſelf to perpetuall and eternall miſerie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hence we ſee the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burthen of the puniſhment of ſinn, in that not onely man is puniſhed that ſinned, but even the brute Beaſts, yea ſuch Creatures as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible alſo; and ſo heavily, that the Creature groans to be delivered from this bondage of corruption, or from the burthen. How much more may wicked men look to be puniſhed for their own ſinnes; yet theſe never groan under the waight of them, whileſt they are in this life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall they gnaw their tongues, gnaſh their teeth, and groan for ever in the world to come, where the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:36651:76"/> Worms ſhall never die, and their Fire ſhall never be quenched; and where they ſhall have no reſt day nor night.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we ſee the greatneſſe of Gods power, in that he could make the Creature ſubject to corruption; he that made it in a better eſtate, could alſo bring it to a worſe, for the ſinne of him that had the poſſeſſion of it: and the Creature muſt be ſubject, it muſt obey. For what was the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſtand it out againſt the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? it was impoſſible for it to do it, but muſt yeeld to be in a worſe eſtate than that in which it was created, though with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, obſerve how God mingles his judgements with his mercies, in that the Creature hath a metaphoricall hope in it, that this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or vanitie, to which it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:36651:76"/> ſhall once come to an end. If the Devils, or the Damned in Hell had but ſuch hope as the Creature here hath, which were ſhort of that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted excellencie that they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, it would elevate their mindes to think of it; but they are under the Hatches of eternall deſpair, without any the leaſt hope for ever. Oh what Soul ſeriouſly conſiders this, and trembles not? and ſets not all things apart to betake it to ſuch means, as will help towards heaven, and miſſe that miſerie? and then may man have a more noble hope, than the Creature here mentioned can have. Thus I have done with the poſitive part of the Creatures ſubjugation.</p>
            <p>Let us now come to the third part of the diviſion, the relaxation, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the bondage of corruption.</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:36651:77"/> The doctrine and parts in this Text, may not unfitly be reſembled to <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> waters,<note place="margin">Ezek. 47.3, 4, 5</note> 
               <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.3, 4, 5. which at the firſt meaſuring were but to the Ankles, at the ſecond, but to the Knees, but at the third were to the Loyns, and at the fourth were riſes to ſuch a River, as a man might ſwim in, and could not be paſſed over, at leaſt not without doubt and danger.</p>
            <p>But to the third point, <hi>Becauſe the Creature alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption;</hi> what was meant by the Creature we have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as we ſay, or the main matter to be decerned, is (how) the Creature ſhall be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the bondage of corruption, and (what Creatures) ſhall be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. <hi>De re conſtat, diſputatur de modo,</hi> Its certain enough that there ſhall be ſuch a deliverance from the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:36651:77"/> bondage of corruption, we have an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>fecit,</hi> an <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> here in the words; and we have it <hi>in terminis,</hi> in expreſſe termes; but all the difficultie conſiſts in the manner of the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, after what manner the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall be delivered, and what Creatures they are that ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. For the former, concerning the manner of the deliverance, ſo farre as may fall within the compaſſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or a rationall diſcourſe, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it can but be one of theſe two wayes, either <hi>privativè,</hi> and <hi>termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi> or <hi>reductivè,</hi> and <hi>tranſmutativê;</hi> either it muſt be delivered by being deprived of its Eſſence or Being, and then as we ſay, <hi>Non entis non ſunt acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia,</hi> of a non-Being there can be no accidents, there can be no vanitie, ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, wearineſſe, corruption, or the like; for when they ceaſe to be, they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:36651:78"/> ceaſe to be ſubject to ſuch miſeries, immutabilities, inſtabilities, and the like, then their being ſubject to vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is terminated as is their being.</p>
            <p>Or elſe <hi>reductivè,</hi> and <hi>tranſmutativè,</hi> by being reduced into their former eſtate, in which they were created, and in which they ſtood before man ſinned, and changed from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into incorruption, from which eſtate, they ſhall never more be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But whether of theſe two wayes the Creature ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, is <hi>dignus vindice nodus,</hi> a knot worth unloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and a point that requires a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcrutinie. If by the Creature here we might upon ſound grounds underſtand man onely, or at leaſt man as yet in the ſtate of nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth, (as you have heard before) then might we

(for the places in Scripture are like Beacons upon Hills, which give light one to another,) it would much move him to this ſenſe, which that pious, painfull and learned Divine before-named calls <hi>The moſt generall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived interpretation;</hi> as when we read of the earneſt expectation of the Creature indefinitely, as Verſe 19.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:36651:79"/> the Creature was made ſubject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, Verſe 20. And the Ceature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the Bondage of corruption, (that is, the ſame Creature before mentioned.) Verſe 21. And the whole Creation groaneth, &amp;c. Verſe 22. Theſe places I ſay, in themſelves conſidered, would move us to underſtand a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and liberation of the whole Creation. But this I conceive would eaſily be granted, for it can neither with faith nor reaſon be oppoſed: but then how the whole Creation ſhall be delivered from the bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, ſo as to be brought into the glorious liberty of the Children or ſonnes of God, <hi>hic haerendum eſt,</hi> here we muſt pauſe a while.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:36651:80"/> but thus, as to be brought into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious libertie of the Children of God, will admit of a further diſpute.</p>
            <p>So farre as the Scriptures hold out any light, or a rationall diſcourſe will carry, ſo farre a man may go in this point; but I have never as yet read, either in the Fathers, who touch upon this point, whereof <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſeems moſt reſolute, and for that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally or moſt generall received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and interpretation before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, nor in the Schoolemen, or middle, or modern Divines is this matter in hand abſolutely, clearly, and ſatisfactorily determined and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

Therefore I have ſaid, that ſo farre as the Scripture holds out any light, or by a rationall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or grounds of ſound reaſon that a man may go, ſo farre he may labour; and, <hi>eſt aliquid prodire tenus,</hi> it will be found ſomewhat to go thus farre.

            <p>All Divines that I have read, or mett withall, fall but upon one of theſe two wayes, by which the Creature is to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, either <hi>aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi> or <hi>purgatione,</hi> by abolition, or the totall and finall taking away the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; or elſe by the purging out the droſſe and corruption from ſuch Creatures as ſhall remain for ſubſtance. But whether of theſe two wayes will the better ſtand with the ſenſe of the Apoſtles words, is the grand quaere, and I conceive this to be one of thoſe abſtruſe points, <hi>de qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus

            <p>Firſt then to the allegation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.29. The Starres ſhall fall from Heaven. The Ancient Divines have differed upon the ſenſe of theſe vvords, ſo alſo have the Modern. And how the Sunne and Moon ſhall be darkned, we may more eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive then how the Starres ſhall fall, for they may become ſo either by great and fearfull Ecclipſes, or <hi>nubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um obtectione,</hi> or <hi>innatae lucis priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> or <hi>majoris luminis obſcuratione;</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:36651:118"/> by being deprived of their innate, light, or by being obſcured by ſome greater light; as by the glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. 1. &amp; 2.</note> But by whether of theſe two later, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is not at one with himſelf, as may appear <hi>in Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitione prima &amp; ſecunda.</hi> Yet Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſay, that <hi>Sol &amp; Luna ſimul Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſim naturalem, pati non poſſunt.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, its obſervable that in the Prophets, vvhen any great &amp; fearfull day of the Lord, by executing of his terrible judgements upon any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Nation, vvas at hand, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it by theſe termes: all which judgements vvere <hi>ſpecimina quaedam extremi judicii,</hi> certain examples and patterns of the laſt and great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as upon thoſe of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> of the <hi>Jews, Idumaeans,</hi> or the like.

               <note place="margin">Muſc. in loc.</note>Thirdly, concerning the Starres falling from Heaven, <hi>Muſculus</hi> is of opinion, that they ſhall fall indeed; <hi>&amp; quid opus eſt diſputare de modo, quo ventura ſunt haec ſigna?</hi> to what end
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:36651:119"/> ſhould we deſpute of the manner how theſe ſignes ſhould come to paſſe? ſaith he. Of the ſame judgement is <hi>Bucer</hi> and ſome others,<note place="margin">Bucer. in verba</note> Yet judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Calvin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calvin in loc.</note> and many other learned Divines, are not of this judgement, that the Starres ſhall really be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their Orbs. <hi>Stellas non reipſa caſuras intelligit, ſed ſecundùm homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſenſum: ideò apud Lucam tantùm praedicit fore ſigna in Soli, Luna, &amp; Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, ſenſus ergò eſt, tantam fore machinae coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li concuſſionem ut Stellae ipſae cadere puten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp;c.</hi> his meaning is not that the Starres ſhall fall indeed, but they ſhall ſeem to fall in mans apprehenſion, and the reaſon he renders, is in <hi>Luke</hi> 21.25. where he onely foretels that there ſhall be <hi>ſignes</hi> in the Sunne, the Moon and the Starres: the meaning therefore is, that there ſhall be ſo great a concuſſinn, or jumbling, or
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:36651:120"/> ſhaking of the Fabrick of Heaven, that the Stars themſelves may be thought to fall. Some of the Rabbins think, that men ſhall be ſo perplexed, that they ſhall verily think, that the Starres are a falling from Heaven, and take no comfort from any light of thoſe golden Firebals, as I may terme them. Others think, that the fierie Meteors, ſhall fall in ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at that time, that the Starres of Heaven ſhall be thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to fall; which yet ſhall but be <hi>Stellae cadentes,</hi> ſuch fierie meteors, as we call falling-Starres. The School Divines, [that are <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> for their Philoſophie] are much bent againſt the reall falling of the Stars from their Orbs; which though they muſt needs grant with the Text, that they ſhall fall, yet they diſpute the <hi>modus,</hi> or manner how, and will not be brought
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:36651:120"/> off naturall reaſon, in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a miraculous and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall work, to grant that the Starres ſhall fall <hi>à fitu,</hi> from their ſcituation in their Orbs, any more then the Orbs themſelves, ſeeing that they are parts of them; and therefore have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed about the manner of their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as God willing, we ſhall hear. True it is, if we reſpect Gods abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, and miraculous and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall way of working, he can pull the knots out of the Timber, and yet the reſt of the ſubſtance remain. Thus God can cauſe the Starres to fall from their Orbs, and yet the Orbs remain. And as you have heard, he can more eaſily do this, then the violent winde can cauſe the Figges to fall from the Figtree. And if with <hi>Muſculus, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> and ſome others, we ſhould go this way, I cannot conceive the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:36651:121"/> in Divinitie to be of any great danger. Now if we go a Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and rationall way to work, as do the School Divines, then we muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incline to their <hi>non</hi> ſeparation <hi>à ſitu,</hi> as keeping us within he ſphaer of naturall reaſon, above which Divinity often goes.</p>
            <p>For firſt, if they ſhould fall, then muſt their fall of neceſſitie be towards the earth; and if ſo, then ſhall their <hi>motus</hi> be <hi>deorſum,</hi> downward, which is contrary to their naturall motion, which we know is <hi>motus circularis,</hi> a circular motion, as the motion of the Heavens is: from which the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher proves, that <hi>Coelum eſt corpus ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ariſt. lib. 1. de Coelo text. 8.</note> becauſe it hath <hi>motum ſimplicem,</hi> a ſimple motion, and that circular, keeping an equall diſtance from its Center. Not <hi>rectus,</hi> a ſtraight motion, ſuch as have the Elements, nor <hi>compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitus,</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:36651:121"/> a compound motion, ſuch as mixt bodies, and Elementary have. For from the motion the Philoſopher would conclude, that the matter of the Heavens is <hi>quinta quaedam eſſentia,</hi> a certain quinteſſence, and not <hi>ejuſdem materiae cum inferioribus,</hi> of the ſame matter with theſe inferiour bodies. Indeed many of the ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers before <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> time, were of opinion, that the Heavens were of Elementary nature; he was the firſt that made this opinion famous in the Schools, that the Heavens were of a quinteſſence, differing from the nature of the Elementary bodies. And divers Divines there are that opine the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to be of the ſame matter with ſublunary bodies, as well as did many of the Ancient Philoſophers.<note place="margin">Averroes lib. 1. de coelo, text. 7.</note>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:36651:122"/> matter at all to be in the Heavens: but this opinion is ſo groſſe, that its contrary to common experience, and ſenſe.

The reaſon the Peripatetiques urge, is, becauſe they are not of the ſame common mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but that he ſleights, but with no great ſtrength of Argument, as farre as I conceive, yet he will have the reaſon why the matter of the Heavens is not combuſtible, or obnoxious to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement of fire, to be, becauſe they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>per corruptibile &amp; incorruptibile,</hi> as corruptible and incorruptible; and the qualities of Heaven <hi>non ſunt eum ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis qualitatibus generis ejuſdem:</hi> they are not of the ſame kinde with the qualities of fire, as in part you have heard before: but what reall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence he can aſſigne between the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers <hi>quinta eſſentia,</hi> and his incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:36651:124"/> I have not as yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſeeing the Philoſopher meant, that the matter of the Heavens was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, becauſe it was a quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the difference is onely verball.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we read not that the Sun and Moon ſhall fall from Heaven, or the reſt of the Planets, as <hi>Saturn, Iupiter, Mars,</hi> or the like; but the Stars, which is conceived to be meant of the fixed Starres. Now when Heaven is ſhaken, why theſe ſhould be looſened from their eight ſphaere, more than any of the Planets out of their ſeverall Orbs, in nature we can give no reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, if what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writes in <hi>l.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Ariſt. lib. 2. de Coelo.</note>

And the Scriptures ſometimes ſpeak of things, not as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but as they appear unto men: as <hi>Matth.</hi> laſt,<note place="margin">Matth. laſt. 2.</note> 2. an Angel is ſaid to rowl away the ſtone from the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre:<note place="margin">Mark laſt, 5.</note> yet <hi>Mark</hi> laſt, 5. this Angel is called a young man, not that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel was ſo, but becauſe he did appear ſo unto others, having aſſumed that ſhape, and ſo was in a viſible forme. And thus the Schoolmen think, that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:36651:125"/> then ſhall be ſuch a terrour upon the Creature, and men ſo perplexed at the comming of this great and fearfull Judge, and the Sea roaring, the earth trembling, the Heaven ſhaking, that the Starrs of Heaven ſhall be thought to them to fall; yet not <hi>exiſtentiâ,</hi> but <hi>apparentiâ,</hi> ſay they;<note place="margin">Dionyſiꝰ Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſ. in verb.</note> and ſo <hi>Dionyſius Carthuſianus</hi> upon the place: They ſhall fall from Heaven, not from their exiſtence in their ſphaeres, but in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance unto the Inhabitants of the Earth. Except you had rather ſay that the Starres, <hi>quoad ſtatum corruptum,</hi> according to their corrupt ſtate by the ſinne of man, ſhould have their corruption to fall from them, being burned, as the Heavens ſhall be.

            <p>Now come we to the laſt allegation for the liberation of the Creature, by totall abolition. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.10.</note> The Heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the earth alſo, and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up. To which I anſwer, (as in part before) that though the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens be thus burned up, yet it will not follow, that the ſubſtance of them ſhall totally be annihilated, but that their <hi>eſſe accidentale tale,</hi> their acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eſtate be renewed, their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities ſhall be changed, and that impuritie, they became lyable to by the ſinne of man, ſhall be taken away, that ſo they may be reduced to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:36651:127"/> a better eſtate. Mettall we know that is melted, or diſſolved in the fire, is not totally deſtroyed, <hi>quoad ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> in the ſubſtance of it, but the droſſe and baſer qualities of it purged out. Thus we conceive it to be with the Heavens, when they ſhall be diſſolved; ſo that neither will this laſt allegation evince an aſolute abolition of the ſubſtance of the Heavens. And thus much in anſwer to the Arguments or Allegations for the liberation of the Creature from the bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, by way of totall abolition.</p>
            <p>I now come to the ſecond, which you have heard in part, is <hi>ſententia communior,</hi> the more common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not onely of the Fathers, both of Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, but of Modern Divines, as alſo of the Schooles.

But now this puts me upon the fourth point, what Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are conceived, as moſt capable of this liberation from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Sonns of God; for here thoſe that are for liberation by way of repurgation, or the taking out the baſer qualities, or impurity, ſaving the ſubſtance from totall abolition, yet they are not all of the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what Creatures ſhall be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of this liberation.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to rank them thus, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch as were created at the firſt, in the ſtate of innocency; Or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thoſe that had exiſtence in the world ſince; Or thirdly, thoſe only
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:36651:128"/> that ſhall bee found remaining at Chriſts comming to judgement: Or Fourthly and laſtly, the Heavens, the Earth, and mankinde.</p>
            <p>Some think, that thoſe Creatures ſhall be reſtored from the bondage of corruption, that were made the firſt ſubject to vanitie, which were Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a pure, firm, and ſound eſtate, and yet loſt this integritie by the ſin of man, and ſo became ſubject to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabilitie, vanitie, and ſlavery, and yet was this no wrong to the Creature ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:36651:138"/> Creatures, which are delivered from the bondage of corruption, ſhall be partakers of the glory of the Sonnes of God. But Brutes ſhall not be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the glory of the ſonnes of God.</p>

            <p>The <hi>major</hi> is denyed.

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:36651:139"/> creatures ſhall not come, neither are capable of it. This well weighed, the Argument will not firmely conclude againſt the moſt generally received opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Again, in the forenamed place, which he referres his Reader to for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he brings in the <hi>gloſſa ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria,</hi> ſhewing, (as you have heard) that by <hi>tota,</hi> or <hi>omnis Creatura,</hi> or <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura indefinitè ſumpta,</hi> is not meant <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula generum,</hi> but <hi>genera ſingulorum;</hi> not all Creatures of every kinde, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kinde of all Creatures.</p>
            <p>His ſecond Argument this, (and it is not onely his, but the Argument of divers others,) There ſhall then be no more any uſe for any ſuch Creatures. Whence thus, Thoſe Creatures that ſhall remain after the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall be for ſome uſe.</p>

I anſwer, as before, it may ſo continue, <hi>quoad materiale,</hi> or <hi>quoad rem menſurantem,</hi> but not <hi>quoad formale,</hi> or <hi>ordinem menſurandi,</hi> for it ſhall not, it need not then to be obſerved, for any diſtinction ſake, as now by men
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:36651:144"/> whileſt they are mortall.</p>
            <p>But it may be again objected, that <hi>tempus propriè dictum habet ut initium, ſic etiam finem;</hi> [that time properly ſo called] that is externall time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly handled by the naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, as it had a beginning, ſo ſhould it alſo have an ending. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it is true, [though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought it ſhould be perpetuall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he held the motion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens naturally to be ſo] for if <hi>motus,</hi> yet not <hi>obſervatus,</hi> if there be motion, &amp; yet it not obſerved time externall hath his end. And in this ſenſe Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> ſaith true, for ſo they ſhall not be for times, &amp;c. But for motion, I would have this obſerved, that not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very kinde of motion, but that which is violent, involuntary, or ſlaviſh, or for the benefit of baſe objects, ſhall ceaſe; otherwiſe <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.4.<note place="margin">Apoc. 14.4.</note> the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:36651:145"/> glorified Saints ſhall follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, therefore ſhall have ſome kinde of motion, but not as oppoſed to their Heavenly reſt, wherein they reſt from ſinne, death, ſlavery, and miſery. Again, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Sunn, and Moon moved in thoſe five dayes, or at leaſt in the time before man was created, and ſo by conſequence before he had ſinned.</p>
            <p>As then you have heard, there was no externall time obſerved from their motion, neither then could their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be any ſlavery to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither then were they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to ſerve any baſe objects, or wicked, and rebellious men; but their motion was ſutable to their nature then, and why may it not alſo be the like after externall time ſhall ceaſe? therefore from the ceſſation of externall time, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not infallibly inferre the ceſſation of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:36651:145"/> all motion, but onely probably, or as a ſervice of common neceſſity.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, <hi>motus eſt cauſa effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens generationis, et corruptionis, &amp;c.</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the cauſe efficient of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and corruption, but when theſe ſhall ceaſe, then motion may ceaſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; true, if theſe were the ſole ends of motion; but motion was alſo for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends beſide theſe. And to this <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> anſwers thus, <hi>Ratio qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem iſta probabilis eſt, at non neceſſaria; poterit enim ille Coeleſtis motus, etſi non generationi, et corruptioni, tamen alii ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cui negotio, quod nos ignoramus inſervire.</hi> that reaſon truly is probable, but not neceſſary; for though the motion of the Heavens ſerve not for generation, and corruption, yet may it ſerve for ſome other thing unknown to us.</p>
            <p>And as a new Heaven, ſo a new Earth ſhall remaine, yet not for any
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:36651:146"/> common uſe of neceſſity, ſo much D. <hi>Willet</hi> grants <hi>qu.</hi> 31.<note place="margin">D. Willet qu. 31. in 8. cap. ad Rom.</note> 
               <hi>ad</hi> 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> the Earth ſhall not then yeeld fruite for the uſe of men, as now, yet may it remain for ſome other uſe. For him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe grants <hi>qu.</hi> 34.<note place="margin">qu. 34.</note> that the heavens by the continuall ſight of their great glory, ſhall ſerve to ſtirre up the Saints to praiſe and magnifie their glorious Creator; if now the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament ſhew his handy works,<note place="margin">Pſa. 19.1.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. much more then, if as the Prophet hath it, and as this Author grants it then alſo to take place, as well as in the Kingdome of Chriſt; the light of the Sunne ſhall be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeven fold,<note place="margin">Iſa. 30, 26.</note> 
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.26. yea, and the light of the Moon as the light of the Sunne, as you have heard.</p>
            <p>His third Argument, The faithfull wait for the adoption, to wit, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:36651:146"/> of their bodies: other Creatures are not capable or parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of adoption; <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither of the redemption of their bodies to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. I anſwer, this is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Argument brought into form, of any other. Thus all Creatures that ſhall be renewed, ſhall be partakers of adoption, and redemption of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to immortalitie.</p>
            <p>But the irrationall and inſenſible not ſo. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I anſwer,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23.</note> that this Text is not pertinently alledged, for it makes an expreſſe diſtinction between the reſt of the Creatures, and the faithfull, that had the firſt-fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Not onely they, but we, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>major</hi> propoſition, thus, the <hi>major</hi> is falſe, if properly taken, ſtrictly and eminently. For firſt, adoption (if we take it properly and eminently for
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:36651:147"/> adoption ſpirituall,) is <hi>beneficium Dei, per quod nos propter Chriſtum in filios re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit, &amp; haeredes Coeli, aeternaeque vitae cum ipſo facit,.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amand, Polan. lib. 6. Syntag. Theol cap. 38.</note> 
               <hi>Amandus Polanus, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Syntagmat. Theolog cap.</hi> 38. Adoption is favour or benefit from God, by the which for Chriſts ſake he receives us, to be ſonnes and Heirs of Heaven, and of life Eternall, he makes us together with him. Now all Creatures that ſhall be renewed, ſhall not have this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, this is proper onely to the Sons of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. thoſe that have the Spirit of Adoption can crie <hi>Abba,</hi> Father: thus cannot any Brutes doe, which are not capable of any ſuch te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie; they are never called chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that God hath given Chriſt to.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.13.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.13. as the adopted Sonns of God are: They are never called <hi>all one with him,</hi> or his Brethren, as the adopted Sonnes of God are. And as
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:36651:147"/> no divine, ſo neither any humane, or civill adoption of any irrationall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Creature, between which you may ſee the difference in <hi>Ameſius</hi> his <hi>Medulla Theologiae lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 28.<note place="margin">Ameſiꝰ lib. 1. Medul. Theol. cap. 28.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, redemption, if taken ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and properly for redemption, by price, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>depenſo,</hi> by a price paid to God, by which we are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the guilt of ſinne, Gods wrath, the Devill, and eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to be put into the ſtate of grace here, and eternall felicitie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, of ſuch redemption they were not the ſubject, neither could they ſinne, nor be ſubject to Hell fire, and therefore need no ſuch redemption: but there is a corporeall and metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall redemption, taken for liberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or freedome from any ſtate of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, or temporall miſery; and for ſuch a redemption the Creature looks, as
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:36651:148"/> you have heard before, <hi>Romanes</hi> 8.21. the Creature ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, that if we take the terms of the Propoſition <hi>conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim,</hi> as thus, [adoption] and [re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,] then there may be in it <hi>fallacia,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>plurium interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationum,</hi> whether the Creatures may be ſaid to be adopted, and redeemed; the one (you have heard) they cannot, yet thother, in ſome ſenſe [as put for freedome, or liberation from ſlaverie, or corruption, or vanity,] they may.</p>
            <p>Again, if we conſider the word (redemption) <hi>ſejunctim,</hi> in its ſelfe, then there is in it <hi>fallacia homonymiae,</hi> as the <hi>Logicians</hi> terme it, which ariſeth, <hi>a ſimilitudine ſignificationis in terminis,</hi> and therefore is numbred one of the fallacies, <hi>[in dictione]</hi> for it either ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies redemption ſpirituall, or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:36651:148"/> and metaphoricall, as you have heard; and how they cannot expect the former, yet do they the latter in the ſenſe you have heard.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, if no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhall be redeemed, but ſuch as ſhall be partakers of Adoption, and Redemption in its ſpirituall ſenſe, then ſhall neither the Heavens nor the Earth be renewed, which is contrary to what he grants; for theſe were not capable of adoption, neither of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption ſpirituall, and proper, but metaphoricall, or a kind of freedome, &amp; liberation. And as for the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> or the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their bodies to immortality, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> anſwers,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> that as the Creature was made corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible becauſe of us, ſo <hi>propter nos immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitate donabitur,</hi> as you have heard, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo for us ſhall the Creature be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with immortality.<note place="margin">Petr. Martyr in 8. ad Rom.</note> And <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:36651:149"/> denies not, but that there may be, <hi>analogia quaedam,</hi> a certain analogy, or likeneſſe, between our glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,<note place="margin">Aug lib. 20. de civit. Dei, cap. 16.</note> and the Creatures made immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: For <hi>Aug.</hi> had ſaid <hi>lib.</hi> 20. <hi>de Civit. Dei cap.</hi> 16. that the Elements ſhould put off ſuch corruptible quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as they had, when our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bodies were framed of them, and ſhould then put on other qualities, which ſhould be ſutable <hi>corporibus noſtris immortalibus, &amp; glorificatis,</hi> to our immortall, and glorified bodies. For though they ſhall not be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall in ſuch a glorious, joyous, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and unſpeakeable manner, as we ſhall, that have immortall ſouls, or ſpirits by nature, and they not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall by nature, but <hi>dono gratuito,</hi> yet ſhall they have ſuch an immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as is ſutable to their nature, as a gift from God unto them, they ſhall
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:36651:149"/> no more be changed, be ſubject, to vanity, corruption, or the like. This to the third.</p>
            <p>His fourth, they were not <hi>ad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitatem condita,</hi> made for immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, if we reſpect their nature, they are not immortall, as are Angels, and Spirits, becauſe their nature is elementary, and being mixt bodies, they conſiſt of contrary qualities, and therefore are corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and diſſoluble into their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and therefore not ſo made for immortality, as never to have change, or corruption befall them, <hi>conditione naturae,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> (as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth,) ſaith, that <hi>iſta immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitas liberale, et merum ſit donum Dei, non poteſt pendere à modo &amp; vi aliqua na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> that immortality by which the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:36651:150"/> Creature becomes ſuch, is meerly the free gift of God, it cannot depend from any manner,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.16</note> and force of nature. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God onely hath immortality, &amp;c. <hi>dico cam complecti aeternitatem, id eſt, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium, &amp; finem exiſtendi ſecludere,</hi> as <hi>Lambertus Danaeus in locum;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam.

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:36651:150"/> their nature, from God, they remain ſuch. <hi>Auguſt. lib. de immortalitate animae:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. lib. de im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. animae.</note> And though the Angels and ſouls of men be immortall by nature, yet this immortalitie, and aptneſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it, we have from God.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:36651:151"/> and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaith, <hi>Vis enim illa Dei, qua &amp; coeli, &amp; elementa reſtituentur ad immortalitatem, conſervare etiam poteſt reliquas orbis partes;</hi> that power of God by which the Heavens and Elements ſhall be reſtored to immortality, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo able to conſerve the reſt of the parts of the world; ſo that immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie being the meer gift of God, he may beſtow it upon other parts of the world, then onely thoſe which that Doctor names. And howſoever many Individuals of every ſpecies, have, and ſhall periſh, ſo likewiſe have parts of the Elements periſhed, though not the <hi>tota,</hi> ſo the ſpecies of ſeverall Creatures ſhall continue as long, as the Elements that now are, ſhall; and why then by the gift of immortalitie may not theſe ſpecies continue, of which many Individualls have periſhed, as well as the Elements from whom parts have
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:36651:151"/> ſo much, and ſo often periſhed?</p>
            <p>His fifth, Thoſe Creatures that ſhall be delivered ſhall be glorified, and immediately paſſe from their corruptible eſtate into the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God: but the unreaſonable Creature not thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer: To be glorified properly is incident to the rationall Creature, he onely ſhall enter into the glory of God in the third Heaven, and have the Image of God perfectly renewed in him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Creature may come into the glorious libertie of the Sons of God, and yet be not thus glorified, but ſutable to its nature immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, <hi>dono gratuito,</hi> as we have heard, and have an Analogie to glorified bodies.</p>
            <p>Again, where he ſaith, they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:36651:152"/> corruption, and their life and ſpirit is extinguiſhed with them, &amp;c. true, to all that ſhall not be renewed this ſhall come to paſſe; but whether God ſhall not renew the ſpecies of them, is <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc ſub judice;</hi> and to affirm he ſhall not, is but to begge the queſtion, and to conclude that for a certaintie, which is in controverſie. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he renders this reaſon, why the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and earth ſhall rather be reſtored then the reſt of the Creatures, namely, becauſe they have been from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the ending, ſubject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, after man had ſinned, but other Creatures that ſucceed by generation, but a while.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, this had been ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, againſt the Individuals of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but againſt the ſpecies none; for the ſpecies of the Creatures have been as long ſubject to vanity, as they,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:36651:152"/> though not their ſucceſſive indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dualls.</p>
            <p>His ſixth: If any ſuch Creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, then either the ſame that were before, or ſome other of the ſame kinde newly created. But neither of theſe. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, this will fall to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the fourth, and laſt ranke of Creatures, but in all probabilty, not thoſe that are already periſhed in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividualls.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we ſay they ſhall have a renovation, or reſtauration, not a new Creation for ſubſtance, but ſhall be renewed in their qualities, ſtate, and condition, as we have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>His ſeventh, and laſt Argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt the moſt generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion, is this, <hi>Nulla promiſſio facta eſt,</hi> there is no promiſe made for
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:36651:153"/> the reſtitution of any ſuch Creatures, as there is for Heaven, and Earth; <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gò,</hi> they ſhall not be reſtored.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that there is a promiſe, as I conceive, in generall, though not ſo particularly, as for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. For this I conceive a promiſe, as alſo do many others, in that the Scripture ſaith, the Creature ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.21.</note> into the glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſonnes of God; and before [the Creature] was made ſubject to vanity. But Heaven, Earth, and man, were not all the Creatures that were made ſubject to vanity. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> to the ſame purpoſe in 8.<note place="margin">P. Martyr in Rom. 8.</note> 
               <hi>ad Rom. quamvis enim Scriptura harum Creaturarum mentionem ſeorſim, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe non fecerit, ſatis tamen eſt quod in genere Creaturas reſtaurandas ſignificave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nequè unquàm quicquàm exceperit,</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:36651:153"/> ſaith he, Although the Scripture make no mention of the Creatures ſeverally, and expreſſely, as it doth of Heaven and Earth, yet its ſufficient that it hath ſignified, that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhall be reſtored in generall or indefinitly; neither any where hath it made any exception.</p>
            <p>Thus have you ſeen the Arguments, and reaſons of that laborious and learned Divine anſwered, upon which reaſons and Arguments he diſſented, (as much following <hi>Bucan</hi>) from the moſt generally received opinion.</p>

            <p>Now for the ſpecies of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I would have theſe things taken into conſideration by the judicious Reader: Firſt, that in the liberation of the Creature, not onely the <hi>terminus à quò</hi> is promiſed, but alſo the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> not onely <hi>from what</hi> the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall be delivered, but alſo <hi>into what:</hi> not onely ſhall deliverance be from the bondage of corruption, for that might be, (I mean cuſtomarie corruption in this life:) by privation of the beeing of the Creature, or by totall abolition: but ſo it ſhould not be delivered (as I conceive) into the glorious libertie of the Sons of God; for this glorious libertie of the Sons of God, is the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> as well as being freed from the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> or corruption and miſery in this preſent life; which miſerie and corruption,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:36651:163"/> &amp;c. I ſay, was but the <hi>terminus à quo.</hi> If the Scripture had gone no further, but onely promiſed to the Creature that it ſhould be delivered from the bondage of corruption, then our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not been of ſo much validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but it affords more, it ſhall be brought into the glorious libertie of the Sonnes of God: but that ſtate it cannot, it ſhould not attain to, if it had a totall privation of its eſſence, and had no more beeing: But being redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the glorious libertie of the Sonnes of God, it is made immortall, in that ſenſe you have heard, having this gift beſtowed upon it from God. For to what I have formerly ſaid,<note place="margin">Aquin. 1.2. qu. 109. art. 2. reſp. ad 2.</note> I will adde out of <hi>Aquinas</hi> in his <hi>prima ſecundae qu.</hi> 109. <hi>art.</hi> 2. <hi>reſpond. ad ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum: Vnaqueque enim res creata ſicut eſſe non habet, niſi ab alio, &amp; in ſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata nihil eſt, ita indiget conſervari in bono
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:36651:163"/> ſuae naturae convenienti, ab alio poteſt enim per ſeipſam deficere à bono, ſicut &amp; per ſeipſam poteſt deficere in non eſſe, niſi di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitus conſervaretur:</hi> every created nature, as it hath no beeing, but from another, and in it ſelf conſidered, is nothing; ſo it ſtands in need to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in good, convenient to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from another; for by it ſelfe conſidered, it may fail from good, as alſo by it ſelf it may fall into a non-beeing, or fail to nothing, except it be conſerved by Gods divine power.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let it be conſidered, that <hi>praecipua pars corruptionis eſt interitus,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves upon the place;<note place="margin">Calvin. in loc.</note> The cheife, and greateſt part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures corruption, is deſtruction; they have a cuſtomary corruption of Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dualls here, but they ſhould have a finall deſtruction of the <hi>ſpeces</hi> there, which were worſe; for here, as the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:36651:164"/> Individualls of ſeverall <hi>ſpecies</hi> are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, ſo alſo others are multiplied of the ſame kinde, and ſo the <hi>ſpecies</hi> is ſtill preſerved: but if all but the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the laſt ranke, be totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, yea in the whole <hi>ſpecies,</hi> then is the corruption of the Creature, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more then ever: and how is this a liberation from the bondage of corruption, when the greateſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption befalls the Creature, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it had?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider that the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Creature ſhall have, ſhall be ſuch, as is expected with great earneſtneſſe, and deſire to attain unto it, even as a woman in travell, that is in pain, diſquiet, and miſery, deſires to be delivered, and to be in a more quiet, and contented eſtate, as you have heard. But totall abolition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any vehemency of naturall
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:36651:164"/> appetion be thus longed and looked for, becauſe nothing naturally deſires the non-being of it ſelfe; the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rather deſires a being in ſlavery, then by a totall abolition to be brought to a non-entitie.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, conſider what the great ſearcher into the bowells of nature,<note place="margin">Ariſt. lib. 2. Phyſic. cap. 8.</note> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Phyſicorum cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra nihil fruſtrà, &amp; temere agit, ſed agit omnia finis alicujus gratiâ;</hi> nature doth nothing in vaine, nor raſhly, but all things for ſome end. The tree hath its end in bringing forth leaves, <hi>ad te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum fructum,</hi> to cover the fruit it bears, both from the heat of the Sunn, and violence of the weather. The Bird in building her Neſt to keepe Egges, and young. The Spider in making her webbe, to catch Flies for her nouriſhment, and the like. Now the <hi>Logicians</hi> teach us, that <hi>finis effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientem
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:36651:165"/> ad agendum movet,</hi> the end moves the efficient to worke; if it were not moved with deſire of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end, it would not ſtirre: now we know that in theſe Creatures that there cannot be <hi>appetitus volunarius,</hi> but <hi>naturalis,</hi> a naturall appetition, or deſire; yet hath <hi>appetitum aliquem intelligentem, ac ſuperiorem à quo regitur,</hi> ſome ſuperior appetite and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, from whom its guided, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. This appetite in the Creature for deliverance is put into it from God, its inſtinct of nature which is not given it in vaine, neither [as you have heard] ſhall its appetite be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in vaine. Again, <hi>finis eſt quod maximè volumus,</hi> and <hi>quod maximè volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, eſt maximè appetibile,</hi> and <hi>appetitus ſua natura, ſemper ordinatur ad bonum,</hi> as alſo we are taught from the <hi>Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> the end is that we moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:36651:165"/> have a will unto, and that which we are moſt eſpecially willing unto, is moſt appetible, or deſirable; and appetite from its own nature, alwayes tends to that which is good.

But firſt we have ſeen what hath been alledged for the reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Creature. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if ſo, God will have uſes for it. Thirdly, if the particular uſes be not clearly made known to us in this life, yet it will not thence follow, that therefore God hath no uſe for them at all; and though it be alſo true, that they ſhall ſee God himſelfe face to face, the glorified bodie of Chriſt, and an infinite company of the glorious bodies of the Saints, brighter then the Sunn, and therefore you may ſay can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo much delighted with the looking upon any of the Creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, as with theſe; I anſwer, take it for granted, that they cannot be ſo much delighted, becauſe the objects
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:36651:172"/> are not ſo eminent in degrees, yet it will not follow that therefore they may have no delight by theſe at all; for this may delight them, that they ſee the poor Creatures, their old, and <hi>quondam</hi> ſervants freed from vanity, ſlavery, and miſery, and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to liberty, and from that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption they fell under, by reaſon of their former diſobedience, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety; this I ſay as rationall, and probable.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, that the Saints in the higheſt Heaven, or in the Heaven of Heavens, ſhall have no occaſion to contemplate theſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Fathers houſe there are ſo many Manſions, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.2.<note place="margin">Iohn 14.2.</note> and joy unſpeakable and glorious I anſwer, it is true, that there is ſuch joy even in that place, yea greater then the heart of man can conceive; for eye

            <p>Two things more there are upon which I would gladly expreſſe my thoughts, as being appendices, or pertaining to the fore-going Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

            <p>I now come to the latter point, how righteouſneſſe can be ſaid to dwell in the new Heavens that he ſhall make, and the new Earth. For this paſſage hath matter worth inquiry in it. Some interpreters do with ſuch places as travellers do with deeps, or boggs in high-wayes, when they come at them, they wiſely paſſe by them, or ſay lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:36651:189"/> and therefore cannot be ſuppoſed without ſome ſubject.

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:36651:190"/> this place ſeemes to me to have bin taken from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.11. the ſpirit of God being pleaſed to make uſe of it again by the Evangiliſt, But the meeke ſhall inherite the Earth, and delight themſelves in the abundance of peace.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:36651:191"/> And though they be often dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from place to place in the Earth, <hi>in hac tamen inquietudine non eripitur iſta terrae poſſeſſio, cujus meminit David: quià et certò ſciunt ſe legitimos eſſe mundi haeredes: unde fit ut tranquilla conſcientia pane ſuo veſcantur, et quamvis inopia la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borent, Deus tamen ipſorum neceſſitatibus in tempore ſuccurrit, &amp;c.</hi> Yet in this their unquietneſſe that poſſeſſion of the Earth which <hi>David</hi> mentions is not taken from them, becauſe they know aſſuredly that they are the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Heires of the world [<hi>viz.</hi> in a ſpirituall right] whereupon it comes, to paſſe that they eate their bread in quietneſſe of conſcience; and though they be ſometimes in want, yet God in good time ſends ſupply to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. So then theſe grounds in the judgement not onely of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Authors, but of divers others,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:36651:191"/> will not clearly bear out his opinion, to hold the new Earth for an habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the righteous, as well as the Heavens, ſeeing it is verified of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall inheritance here, and therefore onely, and neceſſarily cannot involve that ſenſe, he would put upon it by <hi>Origens</hi> aſtipulation.</p>
            <p>Yet this I will ſay, that if the new Heavens be to be an habitation for the righteous, this would, in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be a better Argument againſt the motion of the Heavens, that they ſhould no more move after the day of judgement, then any he hath yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will ſay, that if by the Creature to be delivered, we were ſure that onely Heaven, and Earth were to be underſtood, &amp;c. then may theſe be ſaid to be delivered into the glorious liberty of the Children of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:36651:192"/> God, when they ſhall have liberty to live in theſe, both in the new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and in the Earth: and then need not the moſt accurate, and pearcing Interpreters ſo much perplex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the underſtanding of this place. But this is to be delivered into the liberty of their glory, <hi>paſſivè,</hi> paſſively, to be injoyed of them; not <hi>activè,</hi> actively, for the Creatures to injoy it.</p>
            <p>He urgeth alſo <hi>Revelations</hi> 14.4. they ſhall follow the Lamb whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goeth, ſhall viſite the Earth alſo, and ſhall go and come, as it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that though they follow the Lamb whitherſoevever he goeth, yet except it can be proved, that he goeth on to the earth, as well as in Heaven, the quotation will not help him; and Verſe the 5. theſe are ſaid
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:36651:192"/> to be without fault before the Throne of God, abſolved by divine judicature; &amp; theſe followed the Lamb in this life, in perſecutions, troubles, afflictions, yea many of them unto death it ſelf, <hi>hunc eundem ſequuntur in vitam aeternam quò prior ipſe abiit,</hi> as <hi>Aretius in loc.</hi> this ſame Lambe they follow alſo into ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, whither he himſelfe is firſt gone before them.</p>

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:36651:194"/> for pain and miſery, then may the ſpacious liberty of the ſaints glory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the earth, as to the one term of their continent, as the top of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Heaven is the other; and ſo righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be ſaid to dwell in both, as living within the ſcituation of both, as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in part of their glorious liberty.

Thus have I expreſſed my thoughts upon this point alſo, according to
